**High-Level Architecture Representation**

**1. Source Control & Trigger:**

* Developers push code to GitHub (main branch).
* A GitHub Webhook triggers AWS CodePipeline.

**2. Continuous Integration (CI) Stage:**

* AWS CodePipeline pulls the latest changes.
* AWS CodeBuild:
    * Installs dependencies.
    * Runs unit tests (Jest).
    * Runs Contract tests (Pact).
    * Runs integration tests (Postman/Newman).
    * Packages the application (AWS CDK).
    * CodeBuild Cache is enabled for faster builds.
* Test reports are generated and stored.

**3. Artifact Storage & Management:**

* Built artifacts (Lambda packages, configurations) are stored in Amazon S3.

**4. Multi-Environment Deployment (CD Stage):**

* AWS CodeDeploy fetches artifacts from S3 and deploys to:
    * Development (dev)
    * Staging (staging)
    * Production (prod)
* AWS Organizations and AWS Control Tower manage multi-environment deployments.
* Terraform or AWS CDK manages infrastructure as code.
* Environment Variables are stored in AWS Parameter store.

**5. Lambda Deployment Strategy (Blue/Green):**

* Deploy AWS Lambda functions with versioning and aliases.
* Blue/Green deployment:
    * A new Lambda version is deployed alongside the existing one.
    * API Gateway aliases are used to route traffic to the new version.
    * After successful testing, traffic is shifted entirely to the new version, and the old version is decommissioned.
* Auto-rollback if errors are detected via CloudWatch alarms.

**6. API Gateway & Routing:**

* Amazon API Gateway manages API versions and traffic routing.
* API Gateway stages (dev, staging, prod) are used to manage the environments.
* Routes requests to the appropriate Lambda function version using aliases.

**7. Observability & Rollbacks:**

* AWS CloudWatch:
    * Logs Lambda invocations, CodeBuild builds, and CodePipeline executions.
    * Generates metrics for performance monitoring.
    * Creates cloudwatch dashboards for monitoring key metrics.
    * Utilizes cloudwatch log insights for log analysis.
* AWS X-Ray:
    * Traces API Gateway and Lambda function calls.
* CloudWatch Alarms:
    * Trigger rollback if failure thresholds are exceeded.
    * Notifies developers via AWS SNS.

**8. Security & Compliance:**

* IAM roles & policies ensure least privilege access.
* AWS Secrets Manager stores sensitive credentials securely.
* S3 encryption & KMS protect stored artifacts.
* VPC and security groups are configured for network security.

**9. Secrets and Configuration:**

* AWS Secrets manager is used for secrets.
* AWS Parameter store is used for configuration.

**10. Testing:**

* Unit tests, Contract tests, and integration tests are ran during the build stage.
* Pre deployment tests, and post deployment monitoring is also implemented.

Yes, the architectural diagram is a good visual representation of the textual architecture we refined. Here's a review and rectification, followed by a complete text-based architectural diagram:

**Review of the Visual Diagram:**

* **Positive Aspects:**
    * The core flow from GitHub to Lambda deployment is clearly shown.
    * Key AWS services (CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, S3, API Gateway, Lambda, CloudWatch, X-Ray, IAM, SNS, Organizations, Control Tower) are included.
    * The Blue/Green (B/G) deployment strategy is noted on the CodeDeploy icon.
    * API Gateway stages (dev/stage/prod) are correctly indicated.
* **Rectifications:**
    * **S3 Connection:** The arrow from CodeBuild to S3 should be a solid line, indicating the storage of artifacts.
    * **CloudWatch and X-Ray:** Cloudwatch and X-Ray should have lines connecting them to the Lambda function, and API gateway, to properly show the monitoring of those services.
    * **IAM:** IAM should have lines connecting it to all of the AWS services, to properly show the implementation of least privilege.
    * **SNS:** SNS should have a line coming from cloudwatch, showing that alarms trigger SNS notifications.
    * **Control Tower and Organizations:** Control Tower and Organizations should have a line connecting them to the API gateway, and code deploy, showing the management of the environments.
    * **API Gateway and Lambda:** the line connecting API gateway and lambda should be a double sided arrow, to properly show the request and response.
